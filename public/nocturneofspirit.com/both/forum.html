The Forum is a place where most of the interaction of BotH takes place. You can discuss Misty's novels, post works-in-progress, roleplay, and more.<BR>
<BR>
I ask that you try and keep the level of swearing to a minimum, but it's not entirely disallowed. Flaming (insulting someone else in any way, outside of roleplaying) is not allowed. Graphic violence should be avoided if at all possible, as not all of our members are hardened to that sort of thing.<BR>
