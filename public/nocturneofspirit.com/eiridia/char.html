This is where the characters from all 4 seasons of Eiridia will be presented.<BR><BR>
<h2>Season One - Beginnings</h2>
<b>PCs</b><BR>
<i>Asrin - Tandari Daggarot Pilot / God of Protection and Machines</i><BR>
Before he ascended to godhood, Asrin was a talented pilot in control of one of the mysterious living machines called Daggarots. Driven by a strong sense of compassion, he married and became the Great Protector. Later, he warred with the other gods against Void, Devourer of Creation, and was consumed by it.<BR><BR>
<i>Kiriyana - Moon Dragon Illusion Mage / Goddess of Light</i><BR>
The sorrowful, vengeful Moon Dragon Kiriyana spent a great amount of time trying to shield herself from the pain of the past. In time she gained the power to resurrect her slain husband, and her sorrow turned to joy.<BR><BR>
<i>Iruel - Shadow Dragon Storm Mage / Goddess of Darkness</i><BR>
Wandering master of tempests, Iruel sought after knowledge and power. By merging with the Night Dragon Bahamut, Iruel gained immeasurable strength. She betrayed the others and became a dark force to contend with Kiriyana, Goddess of Light. She built up the miniscule, unimportant country of Nardora into a massive empire ruled by an empress with a black heart.<BR><BR>
<i>Merris - Shadre Warrior / Goddess of Strength</i><BR>
Fierce and strong, Merris gained a reputation for being a ruthless fighter. She helped the others build the city of Haven and created the Ring, a large fighting arena and tavern that became famous the world over for its battles. Later she merged with the God of Strength, Baal, and took over rule of the Empire of the Sun once the other gods were consumed by Void.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>NPCs</b><BR>
Merle - Asrin's wife<BR>
Synth - Sentient weapon<BR>

<BR>
<h2>Season Two - A New Legend</h2>
<b>PCs</b><BR>
<i>Garr - Human Channeler</i><BR>
Possessed of a terrible bloodlust, Garr was a wanted man. His bounty increased from 5,000 gold to well into the billions when he was blamed for the destruction of a large trade city in Rekellia. Through many travails, he managed to successfully defeat his bloodlust and gain a better standing in the world. However, he never cleared his name.<BR><BR> 
<i>Crystall - Tandari Samurai</i><BR>
This deadly samurai was the one truly responsible for the destruction of the city of Avril, though not through malice. She became obsessed with fighting and killing Alexis after an unfortunate argument. Luckily for all involved, Crystall forgot about her vendetta when Alexis left the continent.<BR><BR>
<i>Cr'saea - Human Knight</i><BR>
As a resident of the illustrious city of Haven, Cr'saea was charged by the Order Solar to escort a certain important personage back to that city from the edge of Nardora. Ultimately she succeeded in this task, though there were many complications along the way.<BR><BR>
<i>Alexis - Human Storm Mage</i><BR>
A mage of less temper than Iruel, but far less sanity, Alexis emphasized the cold aspect of storm magic. An incident with a powerful magical artifact caused her to be transported to the then-sealed Southern Continent and the dragon kingdoms.<BR><BR>
<i>Hikari - Human White Mage</i><BR>
Hikari stayed with the group for a very short time, as she was slain by undead raiders during the escort of a princess of Nardora to Haven.<BR><BR>
<i>Calstain - Eliasha Undead Slayer</i><BR>
A warrior who was unfortunately teleported to the main continent when he went afoul of wild magic, Calstain was a powerful addition to the ranks of the travellers. He managed to kill several things that the others couldn't even touch.<BR><BR>
<i>Linnet - Human Rune Mage</i><BR>
Though blind, Linnet was an important member of the group. He was able to unravel the plot of the merchant Harkoan Atreid and assist in the rescue of the Lady Arastopholes.<BR><BR> 
<BR>
<b>NPCs</b><BR>
Lily - Garr's wife, and a white mage<BR>
Harkoan Atreid - A moderately wealthy merchant who tried to sell a Nardoran princess into slavery<BR>
Killian Atreid - Harkoan's son and a misguided but competent warrior<BR>
Shinara Arastopholes - Daughter of a Nardoran noble and one of two survivors of her House.<BR>
Arvaulde Arastopholes - The other survivor, Arvaulde conspired with Harkoan to sell Shinara into slavery.<BR>
Dash - A young Channeler<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<h2>Season Three - Ascension</h2>
<b>PCs</b><BR>
<i>Garr - God of Lifeblood</i><BR>
Garr got married and had a son, though in the events that transpired this year his son was lost to him and he became one of the Twin Blood Gods.<BR><BR>
<i>Crystall - Goddess of Stars</i><BR>
Crystall managed to forget her vendetta against Alexis and worked to defeat Void alongside her. In the end, she merged with the released Kiriyana and became Goddess of Stars.<BR><BR>
<i>Ichi - God of Creation</i><BR>
Though a shadowdancer, spy, and deadly assassin at the beginning of this tale, Ichi's secret hatred of his master Void eventually blossomed and he gained the power to defeat the Devourer of Creation. Following Void's transformation, Ichi absorbed the new God and became the benevolent God of Creation.<BR><BR>
<i>Cr'saea - God of Machines</i><BR>
After becoming leader of the Order Solar following the events of 5 years ago, Cr'saea assisted the others in their struggle against Void. In the ensuing battle, she merged with the dying Machine God Asrin.<BR><BR>
<i>Valkyre - God of Darkness and Fear</i><BR>
Originally a Dragonhalf exiled from the dragon kingdoms several hundred years ago, the Black Knight Valkyre joined up with his long-lost friend K* and the group to defeat Void. Ultimately, Valkyre defeated Iruel and the newly-resurrected Diablos in combat and stole their power. Unlike his predecessor, Valkyre remained true to the group and did not go over to evil.<BR><BR>
<i>Alexis - Goddess of Storms</i><BR>
The only one of the group not to merge with a god, Alexis gained her divinity by sheer force of will (and a little assistance from Amnos/Chaos). She became increasingly aloof and left the group to their own devices.<BR><BR>
<BR>
<b>NPCs</b><BR>
Lily - Goddess of Healing<BR>
Shioku - Garr's son<BR>
