<h1>Driasha</h1>
Long have spirits inhabited the world of Eiridia. While some cultures demonize them and declare them Anathema,
others worship them and still others consider them merely another facet of Gaia.<BR>
<BR>
One of these spirit races is the Driasha, or "Children of the Forest" in the Eldritch Tongue. The Driasha are
mostly human in appearance, but there are certain differences that set them apart. They have wolf's ears instead
of human ones, possess wolf's tails, and are known for having sharp claws instead of human fingernails.<BR>
<BR>
Not only do Driasha look different from humans, they are also more powerful, being spirits. They can move a
great deal faster, and have the unique ability to literally sniff out just about anything. Driasha can track
anything by scent, as long as the scent is strong and fresh enough (at most 4-5 days old).<BR>
<BR>
Driasha in Eiridia are one of the spirit races that are generally accepted by most nations, though they are
still viewed with curiosity and/or mistrust.
