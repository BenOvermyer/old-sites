<title>Races - Human</title>

<h1>Human</h1>
The humans of Eiridia are the most common race. They make up 63% of the population of the world. Because they are so populous, there is no single culture that they share. The five human nations of Eiridia, not including the barbarian tribes of the northern deserts, are incredibly different from each other. <BR>
<BR>
There is, however, one main religion for most of the human race. It is composed of three ruling goddesses - Irtu, the Goddess of Power; Shora, the Goddess of Magic; and Laona, the Goddess of Wisdom. There are several lesser gods, spirits, and demigods as well. Temples are very widespread, each devoted to a single god or goddess. Only one god/dess is allowed to be worshipped at each temple. The three main goddesses have different names, depending on which culture you are in, but they are all the same.<BR>
<BR>
Many humans are suspicious of other races, and some people go so far as to actively hunt down nonhumans. This is especially true of Changed Ones and dragons, who are viewed with hatred by many humans. The only humans who truly tolerate other races, even enjoy their company, are the humans of the Redami Kingdom. <BR>
<BR>
Humans of Eiridia can be found in most climates, though they prefer temperate locales with a minimum of harsh weather. They also, for the most part, avoid forests and mountains, except as trade routes.<BR>
