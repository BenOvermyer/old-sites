<h1>Paladin</h1>
Millenia ago, the gods agreed to cease all direct involvement in Eiridia. However, as time passed, they began
to discreetly recruit mortal warriors to further their ends for them. It began with Kendriana, Goddess of the Sun,
who appeared to Logane de'Irtal of Rekellia in a vision. Logane thereafter trained and became a mighty warrior
who would appear in the midst of a heated battle and turn the tide of war, then vanish as suddenly as he came.<BR>
<BR>
Logane was the first, but many followed in his footsteps. Though most did not possess the legendary strength and
skill with a sword that Logane did, they were still formidable champions of their patron gods.<BR>
<BR>
Now, these holy warriors are rather common, and an accepted method among the deities to influence the mortal world.
Most of the modern paladins, however, do not receive tremendous blessing by their patron, as Logane did. Only the more
devout, the purer of soul, are given powers to rival his. The majority paladins today have weaker Gifts, such as limited
Healing. They frequently form an elite corps in a kingdom's military, or may be members of the various Orders Militant
that are scattered across Eiridia.<BR>

<b><i>Special Abilities</i></b><BR>
Get <b>one</b> of the following as a special Class Ability:<BR><BR>
<b>Healing</b> - The Paladin may Heal someone of their wounds by laying his hands on the afflicted. Every level
of this ability that a Paladin gains can be used to do one of three things: increase the amount of damage Healed,
increase the number of people that can be Healed at once, or increase the number of times per day this ability
can be used. Levels beyond the first cost 5 Experience.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Fell Voice</b> - The Paladin can speak with such force and presence that even the most fanatical of opponents
are held frozen in place with awe and fear. This ability can be used once per day per level, and affects all those
within range of the Paladin's voice whom she wishes to affect. The effect lasts for only moments, however, so the Paladin must act quickly. Each level costs 2 Experience.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Holy Force</b> - Using this ability, the Paladin channels the holy wrath of his patron deity into his weapon.
In game terms, this increases the damage done by the weapon by 25% per level. Each level costs 3 Experience.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Holy Shield</b> - By surrounding herself or her friends with divine energy, the Paladin may turn back magical OR
physical assaults, but not both. The amount of damage dispersed is 10 per level (each level costs 5 Experience).<BR>
<BR>
<b>Conversion</b> - This variant of Fell Voice allows the Paladin to convert one target temporarily to the cause of his
deity. The amount of time this effect lasts is a number of hours equal to the difference between the Paladin's Willpower
and the Willpower of the target; if this is negative, then Conversion doesn't work on the target. Additional levels in
this Ability add one hour to the length of time. Levels cost 2 Experience.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Aura</b> - One of the potentially strongest Abilities of the Paladin, the Aura is a divine magical field which affects
all of a Paladin's allies (including herself) within a certain range. The effect of the Aura is keyed to the specialty of
the Paladin's patron deity; for example, if the Paladin is a servant of Irtu (Goddess of Power), then her Aura might give
her allies a temporary increase in Strength or damage. The Aura can be maintained indefinitely, but it should be noted
that all those affected by it glow slightly. The range and power of the Aura increases slightly with each level. Experience
cost for the levels of this Ability should be decided by the GM, given the wide variety of deities in Eiridia.<BR>
