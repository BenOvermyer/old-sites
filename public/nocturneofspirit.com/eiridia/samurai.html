<h1>Samurai</h1>
One of the most important elements in holding certain kingdoms together following the most recent Apocalypse
was the Samurai, the honor-bound and virtuous warrior. They are masters of melee combat, and the most stable
element in many societies.<BR>
<BR>
The first love of a Samurai is always honor. If honor demands she kill a family member or hated enemy, she will
do so. There are no exceptions (well, not officially anyway; those that give up honor become outcasts, Ronin).
Samurai live by bushido - the Way of the Warrior. Certain principles must be upheld:<BR>
<BR>
1) Never harm an innocent<BR>
2) Always obey the King and your superiors<BR>
3) Lie only to the enemy<BR>
4) Strive to be pure of mind, body, and soul<BR>
5) Always accept a duel challenge<BR>
6) Never attack from behind<BR>
7) Never use ranged weapons, ESPECIALLY not guns<BR>
<BR>
If even one of these tenets is violated, the offender must satisfy the requirements of honor - usually ritual suicide.<BR>
<BR>
While Samurai may seem overzealous at times, they are generally highly effective and well-regarded by the populace. Most Samurai belong to a Noble House; those few who do not are either specially appointed by the King/Emperor/whatever, Ronin, or worst of all, pretenders. Both Ronin and pretenders are slain on sight as the worst sort of criminal.<BR>
