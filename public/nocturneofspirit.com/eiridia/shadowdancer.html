<h1>Shadowdancer</h1>
Recently, a new type of mage has appeared on the Northern Continent. They rival the Magi in power, but this is not why they are feared. They are followers of the Dark God Void, that entity which causes destruction whereever it goes. Their most hated and desired power? The ability to cancel out magic. Entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Though the Shadowdancers themselves are rarely evil, they do serve Void in some capacity. Void simply endows certain people with the ability to nullify magical energy, and some rare ones with the ability to cancel out reality. Some Shadowdancers aren't even aware that they are favored by Void; they treat their ability as a strange mutation, more often than not.<BR>
