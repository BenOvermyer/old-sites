<title>Classes - Vulture</title>
<body bgcolor=white text=black link=red vlink=darkred>
<h1>Vulture</h1>
Especially after the Third Apocalypse, raiders and bandits have become commonplace. One particular breed of these
rogues, the "Vultures," are more plentiful than others. They are scavengers, scouring the countryside and collecting
artifacts of before the Apocalypse (be they forgotten or in the hands of others). Most often they sell these rare items,
acquiring sometimes huge sums of money or an equivalent in exchange.<BR>
<BR>
The Vulture does not frequently run in a pack; he prefers to go it solo, since partners can't be trusted. He's out
to protect the interests of #1 - himself. He could care less about what the artifacts are; he just wants the cash.<BR>
<BR>
Vultures are common everywhere. They run the gamut from well-armed, well-armored vulture bands to solo treasure hunters.<BR>
