 Poem. . . set to flute music, along the line of common song of unrequited love; <br><br>
 <br>
 What would I say if I had the words?<br>
 Why should I say anything at all?<br>
 If through not-action everything is done,<br>
 Through silence is all spoken?<br>
 <br>
 What would  I say if I had the words?<br>
 I dream in the wonders of music and verse<br>
 Yet daylight hours condemn me to prose<br>
 Is music only a waking dream?<br>
 <br>
 What would I say if I had the words?<br>
 Would I tell you I loved you and find it true?<br>
 Does making it verbal make it real?<br>
 Should I say nothing to bind thee less?<br>
 <br>
 What would I say if I had the words?<br>
 Would I tell of laughter and song?<br>
 Or would I spill woe all day long?<br>
 Perhaps silence is best.
 
 So now that the words are not allowed
 I find that I need them more than ever
 Life flows onward, me in the lee;
 And I, I say nothing.   . . .<br><br><br>
