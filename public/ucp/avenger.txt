Avenger Class Heavy Frigate: 

In the Federation Fleet, a Frigate is a ship of similar firepower to a 
Heavy cruiser such as the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701)
but has less research facilities and require less crew. They also have
a 
slightly lower duration on their fuel supply before needing
to refuel because they are not expected to operate as far from 
Federation Territory. 

The Avenger class Heavy Frigate is a class of starships that were 
originally converted from an even older class of Frigates, the
Surya class frigate. This conversion is similar to the conversion that 
was done on Constitution class cruisers and the conversion
was so successful that like the converted Constitution class cruisers, 
later ships were laid down from the beginning as Avenger
class frigates but followed the same design with only minor changes. 
These ships still serve in Starfleet during Next Generation
period and many ships of this class that were in the Federation
mothball 
fleet have been recommissioned and updated to serve
against both the Dominion and the Borg. This makes the class the
longest 
lived starship class within the Federation having
served far longer than the Excelsior class ships have. One of the most 
well know ships of this class is the USS Reliant
(NCC-1864). That is because the ship was captured by a genetic super 
soldier named Khan and the ship was subsequently
destroyed by the U.S.S. Enterprise. 

These ships are better armed than rebuilt Constitution/Enterprise class 
cruisers having two mega phasers as the ships heavy
weaponry. This phasers are capable of destroying other ships in just a 
few shots. To support this, the ship carries six banks of
two phasers each. These phaser banks both act as heavy anti-ship 
weaponry and as point defense. The ship carries four
torpedo launchers as well. These launchers are mounted in a pod above 
the ships hull and two of the launchers fire forward and
two of the launchers fire aft. 

These ships carry a large fighter compliment and carry a small 
contingent of marines for shipboard defense. 

This design is written to be able to interact with modified phase world 
rules. There is a lack of hard detail on this ship. Some
materials have suggested accelerations that are simply beyond scope. I 
have taken a moderate level in writing up this starship for
Phase World because otherwise the ship would either be far too powerful 
or far too weak for Phase World. 

This starship design uses modified starship speed and ranges. See 
Revised Starship Rules for Phase World   for more details.

(36,000 Total)
Notes: 
[1] Depleting the MDC of the main body will put the Frigate out of 
commission. All internal systems will shut down, including
life support and internal gravity. The ship itself will be an 
unsalvageable floating wreck. 
[2] In reality this is how much damage needs to be done for a weapon to 
hit the bridge through the ships armor. This ship does
have an auxiliary bridge. Even if the bridges is destroyed, the ship
can 
still be piloted from engineering but ship is -3 to dodge
and all weapon systems will be at local control. Weapon hits near the 
bridges that do not penetrate the ships integrity can injure
crew members on or near the bridge. 
[3] Shields positions can be varied and all could be combined in one 
shield. Shields regenerate at the rate of 5% (1,800 MDC)
per melee round 

Speed: 
Driving on the Ground: Not Possible. 
Sublight: Has a special sublight engine that allows the ship to travel 
up to 60 percent of the speed of light. Star Ship can
accelerate/decelerate at the rate of 0.8 percent of light per melee. 
As an alternative, the starship can reach .99 of the speed of light but 
is normally restricted to slower speeds so that starship is
not effected severely by time attenuation that occurs at the higher 
sublight speeds. 
Atmospheric Propulsion: Cannot travel within an atmosphere efficiently. 
Stardrive: Uses a warp engine that allow ship to travel at Warp Factor 
7.3 on cruise (0.32 Light Years per Hour), Warp Factor
9.6 Flank (0.97 Light Years per Hour), and Warp Factor 11.1 Emergency 
(1.73 Light Years per Hour). Warp speed is raised
to the fourth power to figure out how many times the speed of light the 
ship travels. 
Maximum Range: Effectively Unlimited by either Drive system. carries 
about five years worth of supplies on board and a small
hydroponic section. 

Statistical Data: 
Length: 774.9 ft (236.0 m) 
Height: 222.6 ft (67.1 m) 
Width: 465.2 ft (141.7 m) 
Weight: 170,000 Tons 
Power System: Primary power system is Anti-Matter with a 20 year life 
span. 
Cargo: Cargo holds are scattered about the ship that allows for
carrying 
up to 10,000 tons of Cargo in addition to standard
compliment of supplies and ammunition. 
Market Cost: 3.8 billion to construct. No ships of this design have
ever 
been put on sale on the market. Black Market or the
Kreegor would offer huge sums of money (40 Billion+ Credits) for an 
undamaged completely working ship. 

WEAPON SYSTEMS: 

1. Two (2) Emperor class Mega Phaser Cannons: Located above primary
   hull used as anti-capital ship weapons and can take out frigates in 
   one shot or do large amounts of damage to bases or larger ships.
   The Phaser cannons can be combined or used separately. They cannot
   be used faster than the speed of light. Weapon has standard
   penalties to hit fighters and small targets. The barrels can be
   fired either forward or behind and can be rotated 30 degrees
   horizontally or vertically. 
   Range: miles (150,000 km) in space and miles (150 km) in an
   atmosphere. 
   Mega Damage: 1D6x1000 MDC each and can be combined for a damage
   equal to 2D6x1000. 
   Rate of fire: Maximum of Two (2) times per melee per cannon. 
   Payload: Effectively Unlimited. 
2. Six (6) banks of 2 Siege Phaser Cannons: Secondary energy weapon
   system with two three banks on the top and three banks on the
   bottom of the primary hull. The weapons damage is about equal to
   laser cannons used by the CAF but the Phasers have a greater rate
   of fire. The phasers are also slightly shorter ranged but only
   slightly. Both Phaser Cannons in each bank can be linked or can be
   fired separately. They cannot be used faster than the speed of
   light. Weapons system has no penalties to hit fighters and small
   targets. 
   Range: 12,437 miles (20,000 km), range is halved in atmosphere. 
   Mega Damage: 2D6x100 MDC each or 4D6x100 for both. 
   Rate of fire: Maximum of Three (3) times per melee each cannon.. 
   Payload: Effectively Unlimited. 
3. Four (4) Photon Torpedo Systems: Mounted above primary hull in a
   pod and fired both forward and aft. The pod has the advantage of
   being easily jettisoned but has the disadvantage of being an
   exposed target. While the launchers are older than those used on
   the U.S.S. Defiant, they can use the same torpedoes Effectively
   very similar to Phase World cruise missile launchers but instead of 
   having groups of multiple launchers, Starfleet has concentrated on
   launchers that can launch more than one torpedo at the same time.
   There are two launchers that fire forward and two launchers that
   fire aft. Once spread of torpedoes has been launched, the launchers
   must reload and rearm before launching another spread of torpedoes. 
   In the early service of this ship, it carried photon torpedoes
   which are anti-matter/matter warheads but they can carry quantum
   torpedoes when they are available. 
   Torpedoes has a top speed of Mach 25 in an atmosphere and in space
   has an acceleration of 10% of light per turn (far faster than any
   starship). When drive goes dead, the torpedo will still cruise
   unless preset to self destruct or receives a destruct code but has
   very low odds of hitting star ships (Great for hitting bases and
   planets because target does not move and torpedoes when dead at
   -25% to detect.) See Modified starship rules for more details, 
   sublight torpedoes have minuses to hit small targets but are all
   considered smart missiles. Launchers can launch on multiple targets
   each. 
   Range: Powered torpedo range is 8000 miles (12,875 km) in an
   atmosphere and 4,000,000 miles (6,437,376 km/ 21.5 light seconds)
   in space 
   Mega-Damage & Properties: Photon Torpedoes (Anti-matter warheads)
   do 4D6x100 MDC each and Quantum Torpedoes do 8D6x100 each. 
   Rate of fire: One at a time or in volleys of 2, or 4 per launcher,
   per melee round, for a maximum of 16 torpedoes per melee. Launchers 
  
are reloaded on the same melee and can be fired again on the next. 
   Payload: 800 torpedoes (because the launchers are right next to
   each other they all use the same magazine)
