  Betazoids are a race of humanoid telepaths from the Federation planet Betazed. Most Betazoids develop their telepathic
abilities in adolescence, although a few individuals are born with their telepathy fully functional. These troubled individuals
generally require extensive therapy to survive in society, since they lack the ability to screen out the telepathic noise of other
people. Betazoids are, however, incapable of reading Ferengi, Breen, or Doptherian minds, possibly as a result of the
anomalous 4-lobed construction of their brains.
