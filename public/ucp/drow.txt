                                            The Drow

  Ages past, when the Elven folk were but new to the face of the world, their numbers were torn with discord, and those of
moral disposition drove from themselves those elves who were selfish and cruel. Constant warfare between the two divisions
of Elven kind continued with the goodly ones ever victorious, until those of dark nature were forced to withdraw from the lands
under the sky and seek safety in the realms of the underworld. Here in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting
passages and caves hung with their icicles of stone, the dark Elven folk found both refuge and comfort. Over the centuries they
grew strong again and schooled themselves in the arcane arts. They were strong enough to face and defeat their former
brethren in battle, but no longer desired to walk upon the green lands under the sun and stars. Yet they neither forgave nor
forgot and above all else, they bear enmity for all their distant kin--elves and faeries--who drove them under. They are seldom
seen by those from above. They still persist and consort with other creatures in order to work out their schemes and inflict
revenge upon those who inhabit the world above.

  Drow are black skinned and pale haired (the few exceptions tend to be bone-white albinos.) Rare Drow have naturally silver
or copper-hued hair, although there are those who deliberately dye their hair silver. Most Drow have red eyes, but some
others have green, brown, or black. Various shades of amber and rose-hued eyes are not unknown. All Drow eyes tend to
grow redder when they are angry or upset. Yellow eyes usually denote illness, disease, poisoning, or the presence of certain
detrimental magics. Blue and purple (and all the tints thereof) are the most unusual eye colors, and usually denote human or
surface-Elven blood somewhere in the Drow's ancestry.

  Drow have superior night vision, seeing up to 120 feet in total darkness. They move almost silently and can blend into the
shadows with 75% chance of success (only when underground or in a very familiar area however.) They are highly
coordinated and ambidextrous. They have a +2 on all magic saves.

  Drow are slight of build and have delicate fingers and toes. Their features are somewhat sharp and their ears are pointed and
large. Drow do not naturally show age until well after their 600th year.

  The usual Drow garb includes: Finely tailored silks, black boots, ankle length black silk cloaks, and very fine, mesh chain
armors of exquisite workmanship. Most usually carry a small amount of personal wealth in a soft leather bag worn around the
neck.

  Because the Drow have dwelled so long in the dark labyrinthian places under the surface of the earth, they dislike bright light.
Drow, for the most part, will not venture forth into daylight, except on the cloudiest and gloomiest of days. In daylight the
Drow have a -2 penalty to strike/parry/dodge, and it is 75% likely that they will retire from situations due to the light. In
addition they are at a -10% on all skills (due to a lack of concentration), and have a -1 to all saves. They are not affected by
torches, lanterns, or faerie fire. After one year on the surface world, Drow can become acclimatized to the bright light, and will
only suffer half of the above penalty but from this time onward will only have a +1 save vs. magic until 1 year is spent below
the surface. After 2 years on the surface the will no longer suffer any penalties save that of the reduced magic savings throw
bonus.

  Drow society has developed along strongly matriarchal lines, with females holding all positions of power and responsibility in
government, the military and at home (although this is not always the rule in all Drow houses or cities.) The Drow worship a
variety of gods, with Lloth the Spider-Demon Goddess being the most common, although the worship of Nocticula is on the
rise in many places. Even among Drow who do not worship Lloth, an affinity for arachnids is strong and the Drow emulate
spider-like characteristics in many ways. Their cities, buildings, and cavern networks are often created in a web pattern. Traps
among these structures channel creatures to the center of the web. Spiders and similar creatures often dwell among Drow
communities, and are prominent in Drow sculpture, art, and fashion. Drow door-carvings and frames for example, are apt to
sport a motif of repeatedly crawling spiders. Drow homes are often decorated by translucent, draped, gray hangings that
emulate spider-webs. Even games of tag, especially the courting games of hide and seek played at festival times by young
Drow, are known as "spider hunts". Any battle or endeavor in which a Drow dies fighting is known as his last bite.

  The Drow culture is perhaps the most widespread and firmly entrenched of all underground cultures. The Drow make treaties
with other races when it serves their interests, but are quick to break these agreements if the terms are no longer advantageous
(agreements with lesser races are not considered binding); this of course makes other races reluctant to enter into alliances with
them. The long term objective of the Drow is to rule over all other subterranean races, and to control all access to and from the
underworld. The secondary goal is the extermination of all other Elven races, including the ceasing of their surface lands and
holdings.

All of the dark elves can use the following spells once/day:
  Dancing Lights Faerie Fire Darkness
  Those above 4th level can cast:
  Detect Magic Know Alignment Levitate

Drow Clerics can cast (at level):
   1. Detect Lie
  2. Detect Undead
  3. Suggestion
  4. Clairvoyance
  5. E.S.P.
  6. Invisibility to Undead
  7. Dispel Magic

  and have a 20% chance each level of improving previous level magics (i.e. cast more times/day, not to exceed base spell-like
abilities.)

  Drow of noble blood or name gain the ability to use all of their base and mature powers more than once per day. An
additional daily use is granted at the end of each decade of life. All Drow with I.Q.'s of 16 or higher, and of 6th level or
greater, can wield a natural spell-like power and a spell simultaneously, or employ a maximum of two natural spell-like powers.

  A.R. 10 Spd. 30 H.P. 4-40
  No. of Att: 2 Dam 2-8 (Claws)

Drow Noble's Hunting Party (used to track and kill escaped slaves) consists of:

  2-4 displacer beasts as bloodhounds
  5-8 Soldiers of 3rd level
  2-3 Soldiers of Noble standing of 6-8th level
  1 Knight/Priest(ess) of Noble standing of 7th /5th level

  All Drow are mounted on lizard mounts detailed earlier; the knight is armed with a death lance which discharges a negative
force that does 5-30 damage in addition to weapon damage and bonuses.


Social Organization

  Social station is the most important thing in the world of the Drow. Ascension to greater power is the ultimate goal in Drow
society. Assassination is the preferred tool in this job. It must be used discreetly in the city, for to openly murder or wage war
(on a rival House) brings down the merciless might of Drow justice (not because of the act itself, simply as punishment for the
boorish act of fighting in public.) Outside the patrol-range of cities, however, might is right, and Houses and merchant clans
often battle each other openly in the wild Underdark.

  There are two major social groupings among the Drow. These are the relatively unimportant (according to the priestesses of
Lloth) merchant clans, and the staid, monolithic noble houses. In truth, both establishments are vital to the survival of the Drow.

Merchant Clans

  Merchant clans vary in organization. They are usually headed by an "inner ring" or council of the most experienced and/or
wealthy merchant members, and hence are usually led by males (the demeaning and dangerous occupation of trading with
outsiders is an almost exclusively male one).

  The membership of the inner ring of a given merchant clan consist primarily of male wizards, and priests of 4th level (or less).
Removed as they are from Drow society at large, the merchant clans have little compunction about dealing with the surface
world. In fact, a few of the "second ring," or managers, are non-Drow of various races.

  The lowest rank in the merchant clan, the "assets," are a mix of Drow, and non-Drow. these are the laborers and soldiery of
the merchant house. Together, the merchant clans forge links with the outside world that enables the Noble Houses to survive.

Merchant trains consist of:

     Small Mercantile Train Medium Mercantile Train
       1-2 merchants 3-4 merchants
       Type 1 Drow patrol Type 3 Drow patrol
       * 5-8 slaves and 1 slave master *9-16 slaves and 2 slave masters
       1-2 pack beasts 3-4 pack beasts

     Large Mercantile Train
       5-8 merchants
       1 type 1 Drow patrol
       1 type 3 Drow patrol
       *17-24 slaves and 3 slave masters
       5-8 pack beasts

  *Slaves in Drow communities are far less valued than those owned by surface dwellers. To a Drow a slave is but a pair of
hands without limits that need to be thought of. If it is killed there are millions of replacements to be had.

Types of Slaves:
  1. Bug Bear
  2. Dwarf
  3. Elf

  10. Orc
  11. Troglodyte
  12. Gnome
  13. Kobolds
  14. Ogre
  15. Wolfen
  16. Trolls
  17. And in some cases other Drow

Pack Beasts:

  A.R. 10 Spd. 20
  H.P. 3-30
  No. of Att: 1 Dam 2-8 (Bite)

  Merchant Trains will typically carry normal goods such as cloth, leathers, wood, food stuffs and the like, there is also the
following chance of some valuable items on the train--30% for a small train, 45% for a medium train, 75% for a large train.
Merchant train treasure types will be as follows (only 2 types will be found in a single merchant train.)
  1. Slaves
  2. 110-300 silver ingots worth 100gp each
  3. 31-50 gold ingots worth 100gp each
  4. 5-10 platinum ingots worth 100gp each
  5. 2-5 mithral ingots worth 100gp each
  6. 1-4 adamantine ingots worth 100gp each

Drow Noble Houses

  Noble houses are led by a matron mother (or in extremely rare cases a patron father, however never in a House that follows
Lloth,) the senior priest(ess). In Lloth-worshipping Drow communities, her rule is absolute, enforced by the priestesses
beneath her (usually her daughters.) Al females of the mother's blood, in order of their age, follow in rank, although they wield
no authority until they are trained and of age (past puberty.)

  Below the daughters come the male officers of the House: the weapon master (leader of the fighters,) (chief) House wizard,
and the patron (current consort of the matron mother.) These ranks may be combined, and even held by the traditional next
rank down in the hierarchy: the male heirs of the House.

  Male heirs are also ranked by age: elderboy, secondboy, thridboy, and so on. the are not allowed to look at the faces of
other Drow, or speak unless spoken to or bidden. This treatment teaches them their subordinate place in Drow society. (Of
course in cities where other gods hold power this hierarchy is suitably altered.)

  Below them come the "war-leaders" of the House (veteran warriors, who lead House patrols, attack squads, and guards,
under the command of the weapons master,) and the House mages (under the command of the House wizard.)

  Beneath these "blood" members and officials of the House rank are its common warriors, its crafts people, its servants, and
its slaves. All ranks are decreed, and can be changed at the whim of the matron mother. Her position changes at death--often
at the hands of her eldest daughter.

  (Even if freed from the authority of an established House, ruler, or realm, Drow instinctively band together in groups. Survival,
to these warlike folk (so often at swords' points among themselves) is often a matter o numbers, trusted battle companions,
and tactics.)

Drow Customs

  - The Drow gesture of peace is crossed arms. Disarming an opponent, and then ceasing the fight is also considered an
indication of peaceful intent.

  - The Drow gesture of surrender is dropping to one knee, letting fall any weapons before the being one submits to (usually
performed by a male Drow to a female Drow).

  - Drow like to give and receive massages; long scented massages involving scented oils, hot water, and steam.

  - Drow enjoy magic and exalt in wielding its unleashed power; they are fascinated by new spells and effects.

  - Drow love beauty, the beauty of sculpture and made items (especially weapons), and of the body. Drow of both sexes are
proud of displaying their physiques and all children exhibiting any physical deficiency are slain or sacrificed.

  - Drow like to party.

  - Drow love to hunt, and use it as a rite of passage.
