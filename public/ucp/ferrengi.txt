  The Ferrengi are a race in interstellar traders who care about nothing but Profit. They are an economic giant, and a military
mouse. While their military does boast some decent ships, the focus of the Space Program is to augment their importing /
exporting business.

  Their role as interstellar profit seeker has earned them a bad reputation in their galaxy. Their race has no political allies, and
there are many races which would gladly conquer the Ferrengi, but their economy helps the galaxy to thrive. Their recent
negotiations within a deep region of space (which they use a wormhole to travel to) has proven extremely profitable and has
only caused to add more lust for profit to the Ferrengi mindset.

  The Ferrengis are ruled by an individual titled "The Grand Negas". All Ferrengis are butt kissers and will do anything to get
close to such an individual.
