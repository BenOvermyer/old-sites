Gundam RX78 GP-01 ('Unit 1', 'Standard')

        The GP-01 Gundam is a Mobile Suit (robot) armed with a
beam rifle and two beam sabers.  It carries the beam rifle with
its right arm and has a large MDC shield on its left arm used to
parry energy blasts and missile attacks.  The two beam sabers are
stored over each shoulder.  It is white with a blue chest and
blue highlights.  Since it has two eyes, it is the Mobile Suit
that looks the most human.

Brief appearance note: The head looks quite a bit like Optimus
Prime's (Transformers - eyes, but no nose or mouth)

        The Gundam can fly, but only for short periods and at
very low altitudes.  However, thruster assisted leaps still allow
the Gundam to maintain a fair amount of maneuverability without
actually flying.

Height: 60 ft
Weight: 64 tons (fully loaded)
PS: 40
Cargo: Minimal, room for a weapon or two
Power Supply: Nuclear
Black Market Cost: The Black Market doesn't know about them,
        but they would go for about 50 million credits or more

Weapon Systems
1. Beam Rifle
Weight: 1500 lbs
Mega-Damage: 2D6x10
Rate of Fire: equal to #attacks per melee, single shots only
Maximum Effective Range: 6000 ft, however, beyond 500 ft a roll
        of 8 or higher is needed to strike, and beyond 2000 ft
        a 12 or higher is needed to strike (requires a fair bit
        of precision)
Payload: Effectively unlimited, however, after 30 blasts in a
        relatively short time, it will require a recharging
        period, blasts recharge at the rate of 10 per hour

2. Beam Saber
Weight: 1200 lbs
Mega-Damage: 2D6x10
Payload: Effectively unlimited, powered by the nuclear supply

3. Minovsky Particle Generator
Minovsky reactors generate a field that scrambles all known sensors,
forcing the enemy to engage in short range visual combat. (guided
missiles have no bonus, and require called shots further than 100 ft)
Furthermore, any opponent bonuses to strike due to sensors are
cancelled.

4. Hand to Hand
Robot Combat Elite gives same as UAR-1 Enforcer except following:
+3 to dodge
+4 to parry
+1 to roll
