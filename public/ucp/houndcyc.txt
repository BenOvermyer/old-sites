FMB Hound Monocycle (Hugh King's version)

The Hound is a military one man motorcycle unit, a cheap anti-armor
unit.  Generally used by way of greater numbers and greater mobility
vs heavier firepower and heavier armor.

The Hound has only minimal sensors: a targeting system and a short
range radio.

The pilot can be hit with a called shot at -5. (usually wearing
body armor though)  The Hound is +4 to dodge.
