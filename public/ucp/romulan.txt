  Romulans are distant cousins to the Vulcans. Some would even consider them to be the same race. Possibly the Romulans
left the Vulcans in a dispute over the addition of logical thinking into Vulcan society. Whatever their roots are, the Romulans as
a race are a force to be reckoned with. They are magnificent Starship builders and have some of the most advanced FTL ships
in their galaxy. They are a warlike race, constantly seeking to add more planets to their Star Empire.

  They are the inventors of Cloaking technology in their galaxy, a technology that they traded to the Klingons for Warp Drive.
Their Military vessels are by far the most superior in the quadrant. They have the utmost confidence in their military to the point
of sometimes being overconfident. This can lead to problems, but has generally led to the growth of the Star Empire.

  On Rifts Earth, they will seek to make alliances with seemingly powerful entities in order to advance the Empire.
