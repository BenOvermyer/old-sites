Samus Aran Power Armor

	Samus Aran - the heroine of Metroid, Metroid II, and Super Metroid fame.
This power armor is what she wears throughout each of the games. Like in the games,
it comes without any add-ons like the famous Ice Beam, and you'll have to buy, steal,
or find them. The armor is full-body, and looks awesome. It has a red-and-yellow
color scheme, with a green Multicannon(see below). 

Name: Samus Aran Power Armor(S.A.P.A.)
Manufacturer: Aran Industries
Type: Cybernetic interface power armor
M.D.C.: 5*
   *M.D.C. is increased every time a Power Shield energy tank is inserted
    into the reactor. This results in an additional 5 M.D.C. per tank.
    The armor's reactor can hold 8 tanks, for a max M.D.C. of 45. This
    armor system is truly unique, because it allows for "rechargable"
    armor. 
Systems: Standard PA systems.
Weapons:
   1) Multicannon: in place of a right hand on the armor is an energy
		   cannon whose armament can change with armor add-ons. It comes
		   with a basic beam which does 1d4 MD and has a range of 500 ft.
		   The following add-ons are available:
			1 - Long Beam: Increases range by 500 ft
			2 - Ice Beam: Freezes target for 2 combat rounds.
				      Range: 500 ft
			3 - Wave Beam: Fires several bursts of energy
				       in a vertical wave. Does 3d6 MD, +2 to strike.
				       Range: 500 ft
			4 - Missile: The MC can carry up to 10 micromissiles which
				     do 2d20 MD apiece.
				     Range: 1000 ft
			5 - Plasma Beam: Fires a high-energy burst. Does 3d12+10 MD.
					 Range: 500 ft
			6 - Charge Beam: For every round charged, this beam does
					 1d4 MD. Max charge is 5 rounds.
					 Range: 500 ft
   2) Bombs: This armor can hold 20 microbombs which do 2d10 MD apiece to a 15' radius.
	     Range: Dropped. 1 round timer, also remote detonation.
   3) **Screw Attack: The armor can allow the user to do a mid-air somersault, which
		    is charged with destructive energy. This attack counts as a melee
		    attack, and a normal jump. It does 1d10+5 MD.
		    Range: Up to max jump.


**Note: the Screw Attack can only be used when the armor is equipped with the proper
	add-on. Costs of add-ons are listed below.
