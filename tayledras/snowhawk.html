<br><br><i>Clan Status:</i> Healer and Craftsman of Feather masks and Jewelry

<br><br><i>Mage Status:</i> Journeyman, with potential for low-power Master.  Snowhawk is not very interested in training her mage-gift much beyond what is needed for control, preferring to work with her Healing Gift and mind magic.

<br><br><i>Bondbirds:</i> A pair of ravens, brothers, called Andyr and M'rahn

<br><br><i>Description:</i> Snowhawk is fairly young, only about 20, although she looks rather older because of her intense expressions.  Her hair is waist-length, and streaked erratically with silver, due to her infrequent use of magic.  She wears it in many different arrangements, although she wears it in a simple thick braid while working.  Her favorite colors are green, white, and gray, and she rarely dresses in any other shades.  Snowhawk is about average height, and has a muscular, thought lean, frame.  Most of her clothing and jewelry is of her own design, and she has a special fondness for silver, often creating matching sets of necklace, bracelet, rings, hairties, and anything else she can think of for her favorite outfits. 

<br><br><i>Demeanor:</i> Snowhawk is rather social for a Tayledras, and although she appreciates time alone, she is often the first to suggest a party or group trip to the hot springs.  She is often cheery to the point of annoying others, although her calmness and refusal to succumb to pity or fear is an asset to her as a Healer.  She is not as naive as many of the non-scout Tayledras who remain in the vales nearly all the time, and enjoys making short trips to visit the Shin'a'in and to assist outside of the Vale when she can.  Her raven bondbirds are natural practical jokers, and she often joins them in their pranks with pleasure. 

<br><br><i>Abilities:</i> Snowhawk is a strong Healer, and does most of the Healing when it is necessary for the Clan.  Her mage-gift, although little used, is particularly good at spells dealing with Seeing - Farsight, Scrying, Foresight, Message Spells.  Even if she isn't the director of the spell, having her in on a link improves the clarity and accuracy of such spells, although no one is exactly sure why.  Her Mindspeech is also of good strength, and Snowhawk enjoys good relations with the hertasi and dyheli of the surrounding area. 

<br><br><i>Hobbies:</i> Apart from her crafting of jewelry and feather masks, Snowhawk enjoys reading history, cooking (when she can convince her hertasi to let her!), and taking in injured animals.  Her ekele is often full of unBonded birds of Bondbird stock that have injuries. 


<br><br><i>Ekele Location:</i> To the northeast of the center of the Vale, roughly two-thirds of the way to the Veil.  Fairly large, to accommodate patients who need a great deal of care, with everything on the ground to accommodate the injured, except for her own sleeping area and her bondbirds' perches, which are a short climb into the lower branches of a large tree.
