<br><br><i>Clan Status</i>: Scout

<br><br><i>Mage Status</i>: Minimal Talent, but she has strong Empathy and Mindspeaking and enough Firestarting to start a fire in ideal circumstances.

<br><br><i>Bondbird</i>: Ti'sha, a large falcon even by bondbird standards.

<br><br><i>Appearance</i>: Her hair comes down to her hips and is an almost-white silver.  She loves it when people ask to brush it or play with it.  Her eyes have been bleached to an odd pale green that occasionally changes color and she is short for a Tayledras. 

<br><br><i>Demeanor</i>: Songfire loves to stay up late and sleep in, but not drastically enough to have an owl for a bondbird.  She is fair at archery and swords, but is a master of the fighting and throwing knives.   She has been described as "bright and alive; very vivid" by her best friend Leaflight and plans to enjoy life as much as she possibly can.  Songfire is known for being very witty, but never hurtful unless she is fighting with someone.  She is also known for loving the hot springs.  One of her favorite things to do is play-flirt with her friends (and sometimes for real). If you want to find her, just look for either green forest-tones or bright reds.   Songfire loves parties and music, and she has a special talent for making people feel welcome.

<br><br><i>Ekele location</i>: halfway along a line drawn from the Heartstone to the western edge of the Vale




<br><br><i>Where you can find her</i>: She'll either be in her ekele or in the hotspings a short distance north from there.
