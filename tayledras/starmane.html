<br><br><i>Clan Status:</i>Clan Elder, mage

<br><br><i>Mage Status:</i>Adept 

<br><br><i>Bondbird:</i>silverwhite vorcelhawk who awnsers (when she pleases) to K'Veedra.

<br><br><i>Appearance:</i>angular heartshaped face marked by strong bone structure and slightly overlarge eyes, giving her a  soulful look, except when caught off-gaurd by laughter, which is contagious to all around her.  Long silver hair maintained at mid spine for ease of containment, usually left majority loose but for a single feather braided in above her right ear, to be tailed by black jesses coming down her back below it. Eyes are unusual even for the exotic Tayledras in that they are usually silver, but whenever possessed by any strong emotion, they change colors anything from gold to violet to stark iris-less black. Dresses in a somewhat dressier version of scout clothing, a great affinity for earth tones and small subtle patterns. She adds adornment w/ the jewlery she creates, for herself and anyone who expresses interest.

<br><br><i>Demeanor:</i>Works with the scouts whenever she can be of any assistance, prefers to pull night watch given the option, Starmane is a social creature who tends to be quiet only until she knows you, and generally only has a few trusted friends.  Goes to great lengths to make sure anyone she meets feels at home, and will do as much as possible to make people's lives around her easier - just don't ask her to make sense in the morning!

<br><br><i>Abilities:</i> Naturally gifted w/ a great deal of empathy, fetching and mage strength, has always been called as a healing adept. Any animal from w/in the vale, or w/out knows that it has only to look sorrowfully at her, and get any love, food healing or general pampering it desires! :-)




<br><br><i>Ekele Location:</i>lives at the top of a beautiful companionable tree on the outskirts of the vale, there is a small hot springs near the tree and less than 2 minutes from a creek outside the vale where many fragrant herbals can be found. Her ekele is directly to the east of the hearstone, on the regrowth and rebirth side of the compass to remind her every morning of life and it's cycles.
