Go'a'uld Host R.C.C.

	The Go'a'uld....symbiotic snake-like creatures that live
within the bodies of their victims. In return for providing a body
for the Go'a'uld, the host also gets to witness and take part in
thousands of atrocities, all at their hands. The Go'a'uld are 100%
evil. They have been stealing bodies for as long as they have lived.
	Most elder Go'a'ulds take on the forms of gods, usually of
a human culture, and take their faction of humans through a Stargate
to another planet, where they rule as gods. Young Go'a'ulds are still
very arrogant, but they are not nearly as ruthless as the elders.

Known Go'a'uld Gods:
Ra - died on Abydos
Apophis - Serpent God of Chu'lak
Hathor - Sex Goddess of Chu'lak, mother of the gods

These are the gods that I've seen in the movie and the series. There's
at least one more, but I can't remember his name. 

Players can take on the form of their own Go'a'uld god, but they will
NOT start out with their own faction of human slaves. That takes time.
Also, it depends on if the GM will even ALLOW a Go'a'uld player.

Horror Factor: 13 ONLY when seeing the Go'a'uld itself.

Attributes are identical to the host's attributes, except for mental attributes, which
get a +1d8 bonus.

Natural Abilities:
  1.) Immune System: Go'a'uld hosts have perfect immune systems.
  2.) Advanced Technology: Each Go'a'uld can immediately recognize and use Go'a'uld technology.

  4.) Glowing Eyes: All Go'a'uld hosts' eyes will glow at will.

The Quickening and Beheadings
  The Quickening is the life force of Immortals. It contains their essence, what some may term their soul. When two Immortals
fight, the air around them becomes charged with Quickening, resulting in the sparks during fights. When an Immortal is
beheaded, the Immortal that beheads the other gains the dead Immortal's Quickening, giving the victor more power. When an
Immortal is beheaded the victor gains the following:

  +1 to a random stat (Roll 1D8), +1D10 to hit points, +1D10 to SDC, +400 Experience (alterable by GM), and the loser's
PPE. In addition, roll on the following table:
  01-10% Gains +1 to any 1 stat (random)
  11-20% Regeneration ability is increased by 1D6 per minute
  21-30% Learns one skill known by slain Immortal at loser's percentage
  31-40% Gains 1D10x3 SDC
  41-50% Gains +1 to parry and dodge
  51-60% Gains +1 to strike with melee weapons
  61-70% Gains +3 to damage
  71-80% Gains +10% to any skill common to both the Immortal and the loser.
  81-95% Gains +1 level in WP Sword (or appropriate WP)
  96-00% Roll twice on the above table and ignore any rolls of 96-00%.

  A 25% chance to gain one talent that the loser had at 1/2 the normal PPE cost. Activation costs are unchanged. Example:
Bubba the Immortal beheads Leon the Immortal who happens to possess the talent of Primal Empathy. Bubba doesn't have
this talent, but wants it so he rolls 1D100 and gets a 12. He therefore spends 5 PPE instead of 10 PPE and now has the talent.
It still costs 8 PPE to use however.

  Two Immortals will never attack another in unison. It simply doesn't happen. If a character does this, I leave it up to the GM
to assign penalties. Same for fighting on Holy Ground. It ought to be something reeeealy bad though.

Personal Swords and Weapons of Beheading
  All Immortals have a favorite weapon that they use for fighting other Immortals. Most use swords, some (rarely) use axes. All
Immortals must get their hands on one of these weapons if they wish to survive. For gaming purposes, all Immortals will start
with a superior weapon with the following bonuses: +2 to parry, +2 to strike, +5 to damage. These weapons are very
expensive and in many cases are very old. A weapon is considered "personal" if it is the weapon used exclusively for a period
of 1 year or more.

Quickening Talents
  Immortals are sustained by their Quickening, the force which keeps them alive and heals their injuries. Everyone has
Quickening, however it is only noticeable in Immortals, a bonfire of energy compared to the spark in mortals. Immortals have
learned to channel their Quickening into mastering certain abilities, from concealing weapons to mastering their minds to
enhancing their bodies. Immortals can select one Talent at every other level (1, 3, 5...) in addition to the 25% chance when
beheading an Immortal.

Blood Fury
  Some Immortals are able to use their Quickening to create a berserker rage that dramatically increases their combat prowess.
When in the rage they will attack their enemy until one of them loses their head. If the Immortal is in normal combat and not
fighting another Immortal they will attack all known enemies and then they take 2D4 melees to calm down. If they are
provoked or if they even perceive the slightest threat against them they will lash out for another 8 melees. After they are calmed
down they are so drained that they are -4 to all combat actions for 30 minutes.
  Range: Self only
  Duration: 8 melees
  Limitations: Only available at 5th level or higher
  Cost: 20 PPE to acquire, 25 PPE to activate.
 Bonuses: The Blood Fury grants the Immortal the following bonuses:
  +2 attacks per melee
  +35 SDC
  +10 to damage
  +4 to strike
  -5 to dodge
  -5 to parry
  Cannot pull punches or roll with impacts

Primal Empathy
  This is the ability to sense the emotions of creatures on a primal level, to feel their life force. The user can detect whether a
creature is good, evil, animal or human(oid), supernatural or mortal. When used on a wild animal the character often receives a
surge of energy or adrenaline in response to the sheer feeling of freedom enjoyed by many animals. This adds +10 to the
character's speed and PE and they will act carefree for the duration. When used on sentient beings the character gets a
momentary feeling as if they were the other person, ie: A Principled Immortal uses Primal Empathy on a psychopathic
murderer. The Immortal would think like the murderer for about 1 minute during which his two natures (the Principled and the
Diabolic) would conflict. The Immortal must save vs. psionics or their alignment is temporarily changed to the target's alignment
for a period of 1 minute. Every melee they get to save vs. psionics. If a successful save is made they revert instantly to their
normal alignment and behavior.
  Range: 150 feet
  Duration: 1 minute per level of experience
  Cost: 10 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 8 PPE are needed to activate it.

Enhanced Awareness Level 1
  This meditative state increases the distance that the Immortal can sense other Immortals. It can be used during normal activity
but at a lesser effectiveness. To use it at full effectiveness one must be meditating silently without movement or distraction.
  Range: Increases range of 'Buzz' by 25 feet per level
  Duration: 10 minutes per 5 PPE spent
  Limitations: Only available at 2nd level or higher. When this talent is used during normal activity the increase in range is only
10 feet per level.
  Cost: 10 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 5 PPE are spent for every 10 minutes it is in use.

Enhanced Awareness Level 2
  By this time the Immortal has learned to bend his senses to detect specific creatures. They are now able to detect
supernatural creatures if they bend their mind to it.
  Range: Normal range of Buzz. Can be used in conjunction with Enhanced Awareness Level 1 to increase the distance.
  Duration: 10 minutes per 8 PPE spent
  Limitations: Only available at 5th level or higher
  Prerequisite: Enhanced Awareness Level 1
  Cost: 15 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 8 PPE are spent for every 10 minutes it is in use. If used in conjunction
with Enhanced Awareness Level 1 it costs 18 PPE per 10 minutes.

Enhanced Healing
  The ability to heal oneself even faster than normal is the focus of this power. Often used as a last ditch effort, this power uses
up great quantities of Quickening that are slow to replenish. For each point of PPE (Quickening) the Immortal is healed of 1
HP or 5 SDC. The downside to this power is that the spent PPE is regained at 1/2 the normal rate.
  Range: Self
  Duration: Permanent
  Cost: 10 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 1 PPE is spent for every 1 HP or 5 SDC healed.

Weapon Concealment Level 1
  Some Immortals have spent time learning how to conceal their weapons from normal view by their Quickening to mask its
presence from others. This ability allows a character to mask the presence of their weapon from mortals by making the
weapon unnoticeable. It's still there, it's just unremarkable and people won't notice it.
  Range: Self, can only conceal a weapon on one's person
  Duration: 10 minutes per level of experience
  Limitations: This can only be performed on the Immortal's personal weapon, one that he / she has trained with extensively (at
least one year), not just any weapon they pick up.
  Cost: 15 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 10 PPE are needed to activate it.

Weapon Concealment Level 2
  After mastering how to conceal their weapon from mortals, some Immortals have gone further and learned how to conceal it's
presence from mechanical sensors as well. This ability takes a fair amount of skill and concentration. The basic principle is that
the Immortal is able to place their sword in a state of limbo for limited periods of time allowing them to pass through
mechanical sensors while keeping their sword undetected. The only person that can retrieve the sword is the Immortal who
placed it there. This means that they Immortal doesn't have to worry about tripping over their sword when performing
acrobatics or other maneuvers hard to do with a sheathed sword.
  Range: Self, can only conceal a weapon on one's person
  Duration: 4 minutes per level of experience.
  Limitations: This can only be performed on the Immortal's personal weapon, one that he / she has trained with extensively (at
least one year), not just any weapon they pick up. Not available until fifth level.
  Prerequisite: Weapon Concealment Level 1
  Cost: 20 PPE are spent permanently to acquire it, and 15 PPE are needed to activate it.

Weapon Enhancement Level 1
  In order to combat the supernatural so that an Immortal may reach the time of the Gathering, some Immortals have focused
their energy into doing enhanced damage with their chosen weapon. This power imbues the weapon with a portion of the
Immortal's life force (Quickening) that increased the damage.
  Range: Personal weapon
  Duration: 4 melees (1 minute) per level of experience
  Limitations: Only available at 3rd level or higher
  Cost: 10 PPE to acquire permanently, 7 PPE to add 1 die of damage to a melee weapon. Example: Bubba the Immortal is
using a short sword (he's stupid, what can I say) that normally does 1D8 damage. For each 7 PPE that he spends, the sword
will do +1D8 damage for four melees per level.

Telepathy
  The simple ability to communicate without using words. Instead the user communicates telepathically. The telepath can send a
message to one person at a time and two-way telepathic communication is impossible unless the recipient is also telepathic
(whether natural, psionic or magic in nature).
  Range: 175 feet
  Duration: 2 minutes per level of experience
  Cost: 5 PPE to acquire permanently, 3 PPE to activate.

  All psionic powers can be used as Quickening Talents. In order to derive their costs, multiply the ISP cost by 1.5. This is
how much it costs to gain the power. The normal ISP cost is how much PPE it costs to activate. Note: This is a makeshift
method of doing it. I will update the list of talents as I get time. In addition, feel free to create your own. If you do, please send
me a copy with details so I can add it to my list.

Conversion Notes:
  RIFTS�: Immortals are MDC creatures in RIFTS� Earth and other MD environments. An Immortal's MDC is equal to their
SDC and HP added together. An Immortal's personal weapon does MDC, and Weapon Enhancement does additional MDC
damage. The Immortal does not have supernatural strength in RIFTS� Earth.

  Ninjas & Superspies� & Mystic China�: Immortals remain mostly unchanged in this game. You may wish to add Chi
powers to the martial arts, and once an Immortal is beheaded their Chi goes to the winner.

  Heroes Unlimited� & After The Bomb�: No changes that I can think of.

  Beyond the Supernatural�: Same here, none that I can think of.

  Palladium Fantasy RPG�, 2nd Ed: No changes, however they are rarely encountered on the world of Palladium. Some
believe that the Old Ones conducted a war of genocide against the Immortals millennia ago which leaves Immortals with an
uneasy feeling when they are on Palladium, a psychic imprint left from the Old One's rages. Thus most Immortals born or
visiting on Palladium leave quickly if they can.
