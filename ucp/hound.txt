FMB Hound Pilot OCC

The guys who pilot the one-wheeled monocycle, armed with a main gun
as big as it can safely operate, working in squads like wolf packs
to take out 30 foot Octopus Tanks brimming with weapons.  They use
mobility and numbers to overcome much tougher opponents, emptying
their guns at Octopus Tanks while dodging the barrage of return
fire.  A few small mercenary bands have formed a few squads of
Hound Units, apparently after jointly discovering a number of FMB
Monocycles, presumably in an old factory or old storage facilities.
