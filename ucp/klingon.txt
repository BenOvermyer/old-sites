I'm sure this has been done a million times, but... This can be used for pretty much any game system, but works best in Heroes
Unlimited and Rifts. This is *not* an R.C.C., but an Alien Race. (Mostly 'cause I'm too lazy to do the Skills.)

BTW, I hope I am not violating any dead thread laws here. :P


  If you don't know who Klingons are then go watch Star Trek. They are a race of Warriors, who believe strongly in honor
and combat. Most Klingons are very concerned with appearing honorable before their family and their Empire.

  Klingons have developed incredibly advanced FTL spaceships using a technology called Warp Drive, and use a technology
called a cloaking device (traded for from the Romulans) that can render their ships invisible to all scanning devices.

  The Klingons are ruled by a high council with the head of that council being the leader of the Empire. There is also an
Emperor named Ka'lest, but he is more of a figurehead ruler than an actual Emperor.

  The Klingons have highly honed combat skills and will often fight with each other, sometimes to the death, for the purpoase of
building up thier comabt skills. They often have fighting tournaments in which many competitors are maimed or killed, for the
sake of honor and combat.
