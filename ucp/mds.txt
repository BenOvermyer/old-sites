Most Dangerous Soldier (MDS) OCC

        The Most Dangerous Soldiers are genetically engineered soldiers
who are trained experts in all forms of combat.  They were developed as
super-soldiers by the old superpowers, and are incredibly resourceful,
cunning and dangerous in the extreme.  They usually rely heavily on
stealth, surprise and guile. There are many stories of a single MDS
taking on an entire enemy platoon, and winning!

        They proved to be too good at combat, however, developing an
obsession with war and combat.  The MDS soldiers were found to be
responsible for acts prolonging war and initiating combat with
non-hostile forces.

        The military tricked the MDS soldiers into entering cryogentic
sleep, but stored them away in secret military bunkers, in case they were
needed some day as a last resort.  In the world of Rifts Earth, many of
these MDS soldiers have awakened to an Earth filled with conflict, war,
combat, supernatural monsters and seemingly unending deadly opponents.
This is an Earth they will thrive on.

        A few unconfirmed reports had Naruni Enterprises indirectly
using a few MDS soldiers (before Naruni was driven from North America)
as one way of keeping battles and conflicts active between small kingdoms.

        MDS soldiers never settle down, continually seeking danger and
battle until they are killed.  MDS soldiers also never form into groups,
a sole MDS will be the most encountered at any one time, in any particular
group.


MDS Abilities (gained through genetic engineering)
1. Heightened intelligence, +1D4 IQ
2. Heightened endurance +4D6 SDC, +1d6 hit points, +1d4 PE
3. Increased strength, +1D6 PS
4. Increased reflexes, +1d4 PP, +1 melee attack
5. Increased speed, +2D6 Spd
6. Bonuses. +2 initiative, +2 vs psionics (iron will)
7. Insanity - All MDS soldiers have an obsession with war/combat/battle,
   they constantly seek it out or instigate it if none is to be found
8. MDS soldiers also gain insanities at levels 5 and 11, mainly associated
   with violence

*optional* - if you use Horror Factor as based on reputation, to anyone
who knows about the MDS soldiers they have a HF 10
(unlikely, info on them might possibly be in some old military computer
files, under high security clearance - even then, they must recognize
the MDS, most likely by dog tags)

the bonuses; two more each can be selected at levels 4, 8 and 13

EQUIPMENT:
Suit of light or heavy body armor or MDS Battle Armor, energy rifle
and energy pistol of choice, 4 e-clips for each, 1D4 grenades,
survival knife, both robot medical kits, utility belt, air filter
& gas mask, canteen and maybe another weapon or two.

MDS soldiers seldom know how to use robots or power armor initially,
but can learn if they can find someone to teach them.  However, they
dislike relying heavily on computers and sensors, so they rarely
learn these skills, instead using stealth and guerilla warfare, and
exoskeltons or heavy body armor for stand-up battles.  Note that although
they do not generally use sensors heavily, they are experts at fooling
all manner of them.  Any robots or PA learned will be fast, mobile units
with primarily simple sensors.  Vehicle will likely be either MDS Battle
Armor or a small, fast vehicle like hovercycles.

MONEY:
MDS soldiers have very little value for money, rarely have more than
2D4x100 cr at any one time

CYBERNETICS:
None to start, and avoid bionics and enhancement, prefer to use "their
own two hands". Generally dislikes bionic augmentation.  An MDS will
consider basic, minor cybernetics, typically along the lines of clock
& compass.

OTHER NOTES:
It can be assumed the MDS has already foraged somewhat and acquired some
basic modern weapons, (see equipment) as well as familiarity with them,
or it can be role-played. MDS soldiers adapt to modern weapons and the
increased firepower in 2D4 weeks.
Until then all skills dealing with technology are at -15%.

If you use alignment, virtually all selfish or evil.
