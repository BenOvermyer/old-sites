Predator Hunting Armor
M.D.C.: 45 A.R.: 12
  Wire mesh covers body, armor plates on both shoulders, forearms, shins, thighs, as well as the groin area (5 MDC apiece).
However, the mesh emits a field which dissipates energy attacks. This provides an AR of 17 and 80 MDC against Plasma,
Ion, and Laser weapons, as well as vibro blades (which do inflict SDC damage, if they roll between 12 and 17). The mesh's
MDC regenerates at a rate of 1D4 MDC per minute, recharging via a standard 20-year nuclear battery. The mesh itself is an
SDC structure, and can take 30 SDC before tearing and reducing the amount of MDC output by half and dropping the AR to
15. If it takes 80 SDC, it is basically destroyed.
  However, it is EXTREMELY hard to hit - called shots are -8 to strike. There is a chance that an attack accidentally hits it, as
well - any roll of 24 or higher (obviously modified), or any natural twenty does damage to the SDC of the mesh. Note: The
mesh does not protect the Predator from SDC damage - all damage done to it is taken by the Predator as well. It DOES
prevent MDC damage.
  The forearm portions of the armor (5 MDC ea.) contain various interesting implements. In the right forearm are two claws.
These can be extended and used as a weapon to deal 2d6 x 10 SDC + PS bonus, or their vibro-component can be activated,
making them mega-damage weapons which deal 3D6 MD (total - the two blades attack together, and cannot be used one at a
time).
  The left forearm contains the Predator's most deadly tool: The cloaking device. When activated, it bends electromagnetic
energy around the Predator, effectively rendering it invisible. It can in fact be seen, as it has a shimmering outline - Detect
Concealment has a -50% penalty if it is not moving, and a -25% penalty if moving. If the character does not have Detect
Concealment, their base percentage to spot a MOVING Predator is equal to their IQ divided by two. See the Invisible has
NO EFFECT. In addition, Lasers do NO damage - the light is bent around the Predator to reform on the other side,
continuing on to hit whatever is behind it. Ion and Particle beam weapons do 1/2 damage, but all attackers are -8 to strike.
Invisible Predators have Prowl values of 95%. Fortunately, there are limitations - it can only be active for 1 hour before it must
recharge - recharging takes a time equal to the amount of time it was active. However, it is constantly recharging, so it can be
used briefly for long periods of time (30 minutes an hour indefinitely).
  Lastly, on the left forearm there is a keypad which is used to detonate the nuclear power pack, in the event that the Predator
is mortally wounded or captured with no hope of escape. The explosion does 1D6 x 50 MD to everything within a 200'
radius, 1/2 that to everything within 300', and 1/10 that to everything within 500' (Note: these are not cumulative - imagine 3
concentric circles. Inside the first does 1D6 x 50 MD, between the first and the second does 1/2 that, etc.).

Note: The cloaking device/detonator can be disabled by doing 4 MD to the left forearm. This is a called shot and is -3 to
strike in melee, and -3 for every 50', long-range.
  The left shoulder contains a first aid kit which has tools that can be used to perform first aid on a Predator (not all standard
techniques that work on humans work on Predators, since their physiology is different) Note: The human Predators will have
human first aid kits.


Predator Battle Armor:
M.D.C.: 150
Prowl Penalty: -20%
Weight: 25 lb
A.R.: 19 (Does not include head protection)
  Heavy Battle Armor specifically tailored for each individual Predator. It is NEVER worn in the Hunt. Even Rogues will not
CONSIDER using it in the Hunt.
  It is used in an all-out attack, typically in the company of many other Predators. Thus, it has no cloaking device, nor does it
have a nuclear detonator. In addition, Plasma Caster (see below) cannot be attached to the Battle Armor, since there is no
nuclear power source for them to draw upon.
  Most often, E-Rifles are the weapon of choice to accompany the Battle Armor.

Note: It is VERY rare to see a Predator in this armor. I've seen it in ONE comic book that I've read (Aliens vs. Predator:
War #1). It is really only used in all-out war.


Plasma Caster:
  This weapon is attached to the right shoulder and is hardwired to the Predator's sight. This, in combination with the
triangle-shaped laser-targeting system give the Predator a +3 to strike with the Plasma Caster.
Damage: 2D6 MD
Range: 500'
Ammo: Unlimited (connected to power source in armor)
Rate of Fire: 3 per melee (15 seconds)
Falls under WP: E-Pistol


Collapsible Spear:
A 3' long pole which telescopes to a 6' spear, pointed at both ends.
Damage (+ PS bonus):
   Club (not telescoped): 3D6
   Spear (held): 4D6
   Spear (thrown): 6D6
Max Range: 150', - 1 to strike per 10' beyond 100'
Falls under WP: Blunt (Including handheld spear) and WP: Archery/Targeting


Boomerang Disc:
  10" in diameter, this small, basically circular disc always returns to the thrower. It is somewhat collapsible - it collapses in the
middle, becoming ellipsoid with a minor radius of 5" (and a major radius of 10")
Damage: 5D6 (does NOT get PS bonus)
Max Range: 200'


Hunting Mask:
10 MDC, adds 3 to AR of both previously mentioned armors. Provides following abilities:
-Has its own, self-contained air supply. Predators CAN breathe air, but it is difficult, halving the amount of time they can exert
themselves. The air system provides air for 8 hours, but replenishes itself, when possible with components of the outside air.
Note: Predators breathe mostly methane, with a few other gasses mixed in. (Flammable? You betcha.)
-Amplifies user's natural vision: adds 1000', provides passive nightvision to human wearers.


Net Gun:
  This is a small, handheld weapon which fires a titanium-alloy wire mesh to capture and hold prone an opponent. When the
mesh is fired and scores a successful hit, the target must roll higher than the attack roll on a 1D20 to avoid being knocked
down. If they attempted a dodge, however, they do not get this roll - they are automatically pinned, either to the ground
approximately 20' away or to the nearest vertical structure that will support their weight.
  The initial attack does 2D6 SDC due to the tearing the mesh does against the body; in addition, struggling against it, or the
impact with the ground/wall will do damage (even in MDC body armor, as per the tables in the RIFTS Rule book, page 12).
Treat as a high speed crash at 50 mph or a fall from 10 feet, depending upon whether they were propelled into a wall or into
the ground.
  In addition, struggling against the mesh does 1D4 SDC per round (# of chances to break free = # of attacks per melee). It
takes a combined PS of 25 to break free (most characters will need someone else's help).
  Predators use this to hold their prey immobile while they either dispatch with others or advance upon the helpless victim. The
net gun is not used with tremendous frequency by Predators, but is one of the many weapons available to them. It falls under
WP: Revolver.
Other useful info:
Ammo: 1 net (takes 1 minute to reload)
Range: 200'
Damage: see above
  The mesh has a total of 100 SDC, but only 20 SDC must be dealt to it to cut a hole in it big enough for a human to escape
through.
