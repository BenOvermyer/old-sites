  These guys are Starfleetï¿½s equivalent to the CIA. These operatives are extremely skilled and dangerous. Any job that can not
be handled by diplomacy and the Prime Directive is handled by them. They are a highly secret agency, with a nearly 100%
success rate.

  They work under direct control of the Military and do not have to answer to the Government. Most are not Academy
Graduates and the few that are were may have served a small term in the Starfleet. Recruits are chosen for their leadership
qualities, Intelligence, and a will to fight for the UFP. They must spend 3 years in training, and only the top 5% of all recruits
graduate. The rest are sent back to Starfleet with a promotion and a raise, or sent on their way. The ones that do graduate,
must go through another 4 years of training before becoming field operatives.

  A tour of duty is 5 years, and all operatives must serve at least two terms. They are then given the option to remain in the
service, or retire at the ripe age of 35 and enjoy luxury the rest of their lives.

Attribute Requirements: I.Q. 10, M.E. 11, M.A. 13. A good P.S. and P.E. are helpful but not necessary.

Money: Contrary to popular belief Starfleet Personnel are given a salary. For a Special Operative it is 5000 Starfleet Credits

Credits for every 3 Rifts credits. 

Cybernetics: None. Would not necessarily be opposed to cybernetic implants, but Starfleet generally frowns upon them.
Definitely no Bionic limbs.
